## "Building It" Tutorial 

Thanks to Daniel Kehoe aka [fortuity](https://github.com/fortuity)

A complete walkthrough tutorial is available on the Daniel Kehoe's and [Fernando Tapia Rico's (me)](http://fernandotapiarico.com) wiki:

#### [Rails3-Mongoid-Devise walkthrough tutorial](http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise/wiki/Tutorial-%28Walkthrough%29)

#### [OmniAuth Installation Tutorial](https://github.com/fertapric/rails3-mongoid-devise-omniauth/wiki/OmniAuth-Installation-Tutorial)

The tutorial documents each step to follow to create the application. 
Every step is documented concisely, so a complete beginner can create this application without any additional knowledge. 
However, no explanation is offered for any of the steps, so if you are a beginner, you’re advised to look for an introduction to Rails elsewhere. 
Refer to the [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.info/) site for help if you are a beginner. 
Or read Michael Hartl's [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://railstutorial.org/) book.

If you simply wish to modify the application for your own project, you can download the application and set it up as described below, without following the tutorial.
